1. Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.

    A RDBMS or Relational Database Management System is software that manages the actions that are performed on the database, whereas SQL is the language that is used to interact with the software and tell it what to do.


2. Why do tables need a primary key?

    A primary key helps identify a specific row in a table. 
    The primary keys are unique because they allow you to differentiate between the rows.


3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

    A foreign key is the identity of a column that would link/reference the primary key of one table to another.


4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

    You need a table that lives between them that connects them by foreign keys.
